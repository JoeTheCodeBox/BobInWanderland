# BobInWanderland
This is my entry level unity project made for university. 
Controls: 
S - X to move back and forth,
A - D to move left and right,
W - E to move up and down,
U - I to speed up and slow down,
N - M to scale up and scale down,
Keyboard arrows to move camera along the global axis,
Plus and minus to move the camera up and down.
Move bob to the cubes to change his color!
Some cubes change his size.
Don't scale him too much or too little though, something might happen!
